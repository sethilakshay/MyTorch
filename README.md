# MyTorch

This repository is my attempt to build an alternative to PyTorch and code several popular deep learning end to end model methods from Scratch. To this end, I coded the following methods and all their supporting methods from scratch.

1. Linear Models (MLPs): Contains codes for building an end to simple MLP model with activation functions, optimizers such as SGD, Adam and AdamW etc.
2. CNN Models: Codes for implementing 1D and 2D CNN with all supporting methods such as batchnorm and dropout.
3. RNN and GRU (NLP): Codes for GRU Cell, RNN Cell, CTC and CTC decoding.
